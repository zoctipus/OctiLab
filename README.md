## Overview

This repository was originally developed from Isaac Lab Extension Template. Now it extends additional features and 
environment on top of Isaac Lab, and intend to serve as a more wellrounded robot learning developing platform. 
It is currently actively maintained and more robots and features are coming along. This extension is carefully
implemented in a non-destructive, easy-to-update manner, as it inherits as much as from Isaac Lab, so it updates
as soon as Isaac Lab updates.
